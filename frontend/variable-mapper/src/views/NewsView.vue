        We're thrilled to share that our team is actively working on PD-Mapper, a specialized tool dedicated to the semantic harmonization of variable conventions within Parkinson's disease cohorts. This tool aims to simplify the complexities of data integration and enhance collaboration among researchers in the Parkinson's disease community. Stay tuned for more updates on PD-Mapper and its potential to revolutionize data management in PD research.
